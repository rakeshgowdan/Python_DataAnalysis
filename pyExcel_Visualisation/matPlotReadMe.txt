Matplotlib is a python library used to create 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts.
It has a module named pyplot which makes things easy for plotting by providing feature to control line styles, font properties,
formatting axes etc. It supports a very wide variety of graphs and plots namely - histogram, bar charts, power spectra,
error charts etc. It is used along with NumPy to provide an environment that is an effective open source alternative for MatLab.
It can also be used with graphics toolkits like PyQt and wxPython.

Conventionally, the package is imported into the Python script by adding the following statement âˆ’

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
